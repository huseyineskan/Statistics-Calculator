# Statistics Calculator
In this statistical calculator project, we gained experience in handling user input, DOM manipulation, and method chaining. We practiced doing statistical calculations such as mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation.

## Description
We have made the project work effectively by using `reduce()`, `slice()`, `sort()`, `filter()`, `join()`, `split()`, `map()`, `isNaN()`, `Math.floor()`, `Math.sqrt()` functions. You can calculate multiple results at the same time in a short time.
